DESCR: LiteSpeed's Rack/Rails Shared Hosting settings allow users 
using our high performance, highly scalable Ruby LSAPI module to 
easily control their customers' Ruby usage.


LiteSpeed Rack/Rails hosting solution can deliver the best
performance with minimum server resource requirement. In addition,
it is compatible with all existing web hosting control panels. 


The user-manageable Rack/Rails configuration file (".ls_rails_config") 
is located in the user's home directory or virtual host root directory.  
Syntax is as follows: 

<blockquote>
#RailsApp <name> <App Path> <Rails Evn> <Children Processes> <RunOnStart>

RailsApp testApp "/lsws/testrails" "development" 4 1 


#RailsAppMap <name> <domain> <URI> 

RailsAppMap testApp "testrails.com" "/" 

RailsAppMap testApp "test.testrails.com" "/" 
</blockquote>

The "App Path" is relative to the user's home directory or the virtual
host root directory.


Whenever this file is touched, Rack/Rails applications will be restarted.
